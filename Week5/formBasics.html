		<!-- The form element is used to get users input in an organized fashion
			We add specific inputs to the form element to organize the users info
			in a logical fashion and then submit that to a server to process that
			information -->
		
		<!-- The action attribute specifies a url to send the information to
			
			The target attributes specifies how the submit function renders in the window
				A blank value means a new window is opened
				By default this is "self" meaning that it opens in the same page as itself
			
			The method attribute is the HTTP method relating to how the information is sent
				GET - user input is in the address bar
				POST - user input is not in the address bar -->
				
		<form action="NotePadWebsite.html" target="blank" method="POST">
			
			<!-- We use the input element to specify the type of input the user can input
				There are various attributes we can add to the input like:
					type - Specifies the type of input
					name - Gives the value a name, needed to actually send the data as they
							are kept in key value pairs. If ignored then submit will not send it
					placeholder - Gives a hint to the user, will disappear once they start typing
					required - forces the user to input something otherwise nothing will be sent -->
			
			Username: <br> <input id="loginUsername" type="text" name="username" placeholder="USERNAME" required/>
			Password: <br> <input type="password" name="password"/>
			<br>
			Age: <br> <input type="number" min="18" max="9999" required/>
			
			<!-- The input type of submit is required inside the form element to submit the inputs of
				the user together
				These inputs are rendered as unique buttons that include additional functionality over
				the default button type which just looks like a button -->
			<input type="submit" value="Press me"/>
			<input type="reset" value="RESET"/>
			<input type="button" value="this is a button"/>
		</form>
		
		<!-- This is a form using the radio button input type, radio buttons only allow one option
			to be checked at a time
			This single option functionality only works if the radio buttons are within a form element-->
			
		<!-- We use the label tag to give a label to the input instead of just putting in plain text within
			the form element-->
		<form>
			SELECT POKEMON
			<br>
			<input type="radio" name="charizard" id="charizard">
			<label for="charizard">Charizard</label><br>
			<input type="radio" name="squirtle" id="squirtle">
			<label for="squirtle">Squirtle</label><br>
			<input type="radio" name="bulbasaur" id="bulbasaur">
			<label for="bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</label><br>
			<input type="submit"/>
			<input type="reset"/>
		</form>
		
		<!-- This is the checkbox input type, this allows multiple checks in the form -->
		<form>
			<b>Select Subjects</b>
			<br>
			<input type="checkbox" name="subject" id="math"/>
			<label for="math">Math</label>
			<input type="checkbox" name="subject" id="science"/>
			<label for="science">Science</label>
			<input type="submit">
		</form>
		
		<!-- This is the select drop down input type
		
			We use the select element to specify that all the options inside it are in the same list
			
			The option element is used to give the users multiple selects
			This effectively works like a radio button where only one can be selected at a time 
			Make sure to include value and the Text option, they are not the same, the value attribute
			is what will be sent on the address bar when submit is pressed by the user not the Text visible
			to the user -->
		<form>
			<label for="country">Country:</label>
			<select name="country" id="country">
				<option value="USA">USA</option>
				<option value="UK">UK</option>
			</select>
			<input type="submit"/>
		</form>
